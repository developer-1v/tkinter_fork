# Project Title

## Purpose
This project is simply a pip-installable fork of tkinter that simplifies the installation process for tkinter when creating standalone applications that require it. Several exe creators have trouble installing tkinter even though it is part of the standard library. This project is a solution to that problem.

## Credits
This project builds upon the work of the original Python authors and the developers of the Tkinter library. We acknowledge and appreciate their significant contributions to the Python community.

### Python Authors
Python was originally conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands.

### Tkinter Authors
Tkinter, Python's de-facto standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) package, is a thin object-oriented layer on top of Tcl/Tk. Tkinter development has been contributed to by numerous individuals in the Python community over the years.
