# Project Title

## Purpose
This project provides a pip-installable version of tkinter, designed to streamline the installation process for standalone applications that depend on it. Many executable creators face challenges with integrating tkinter, despite its inclusion in the standard library. This project is a solution to that problem.

## Acknowledgments
This project recognizes the essential contributions of the original Python authors and the Tkinter library developers. Their efforts have significantly advanced the Python community and enabled numerous technological innovations.

### Python Authors
Python was originally conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands.

### Tkinter Authors
Tkinter, Python's de-facto standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) package, is a thin object-oriented layer on top of Tcl/Tk. Tkinter development has been contributed to by numerous individuals in the Python community over the years.
